# Unit 4 Chapter 2 Question 3 - Bird Tally

Use bird-store.txt in your function. Each line represents a species of a bird that is available at the store. Since multiple birds can have the same species, there are duplicate species. The store only sells chicken, goose, dodo, ostrich, and parrot. Tally up how many birds of each species are present, and print a string of integers separated by commas of the tally, starting with chicken (as it appears in this question).
