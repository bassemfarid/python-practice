# Python Practice

## How to Solve Problems

1. Begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.
2. Open the ##-##-##.md file in each folder to read the problem instructions.
3. Create a ##-##-##.py file in the same folder. You must do this for each problem.
4. Write your program solution according to the problem instructions.
5. Run the ##-##-##-test.py file in the same folder. Adjust your program until all tests pass.

## Getting Updates

As new problems are added, you’ll need to pull updates into your fork.

First, ensure this repository is set as the upstream remote. If it’s not, add it:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bassemfarid/python-practice.git
```

Then, fetch updates and merge them:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main --no-commit --no-ff
```

This won’t overwrite your solutions but will add new problems and tests.
