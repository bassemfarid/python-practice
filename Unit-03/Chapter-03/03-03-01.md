# Unit 3 Chapter 3 Question 1 - Happy Holidays

Create a for loop that does a countdown to the holidays starting at 15 days before the holidays. You do not have to make it in real-time waiting, just do all the prints at once.

## Output Specifications
Every line should read "$x$ days till holidays!", with $x$ being a number starting at 15 and decreasing by 1 every time the loop runs.
The program should also output "Happy holidays!" when the countdown reaches 0, without printing "0 days till holidays!"
