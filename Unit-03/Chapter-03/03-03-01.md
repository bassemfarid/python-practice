# Unit 3 Chapter 3 Question 1 - Happy Holidays

Create a for loop that does a countdown to the holidays starting at 15 days before the holidays. For every day, it should read “x days till holidays!”. When there are zero days left, meaning it is the holiday, it should say “Happy holidays!”. You do not have to make it in real-time waiting, just do all the prints at once.

## Output Specifications
Every line should read "$x$ days till holidays!", with $x$ being a number starting at 15 and decreasing by 1 every time the loop runs.
The program should also output "Happy holidays!" when the countdown reaches 0, without printing "0 days till holidays!"
