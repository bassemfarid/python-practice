# Unit 3 Chapter 6 Question 1 - Secret Agent Messages
As a top-secret agent, you need to send encrypted messages to your handler. You've agreed to use the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a program that can encrypt your messages using a given key.

The encryption process involves shifting each letter in the message $M$ by a fixed number of positions specified by the key $K$. For example, with a key of $3$, 'A' would become 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on. The cipher should wrap around the alphabet, so with a key of $3$, 'X' becomes 'A', 'Y' becomes 'B', and 'Z' becomes 'C'. The shift can also be negative, meaning letters are shifted backwards. Spaces in the message should remain unchanged.

## Input Specification
There will be two lines of input.
1.  The first line contains the message $M$ to be encrypted. This message will consist only of uppercase English letters (A-Z) and spaces. The length of the message will be between 1 and 1000 characters, inclusive.
2.  The second line contains an integer $K$, the cipher key. $K$ will be between $-25$ and $25$, inclusive.

## Output Specification
Output a single line containing the encrypted message. The output message should preserve the original spacing and consist only of uppercase English letters and spaces.

## Sample Input 1
```
HELLO WORLD
3
```

## Output for Sample Input 1
```
KHOOR ZRUOG
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 1
Each letter in `HELLO WORLD` is shifted forward by $3$ positions. 'H' becomes 'K', 'E' becomes 'H', 'L' becomes 'O', 'O' becomes 'R', 'W' becomes 'Z', 'R' becomes 'U', 'L' becomes 'O', and 'D' becomes 'G'. Spaces are preserved.

## Sample Input 2
```
THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
-5
```

## Output for Sample Input 2
```
OCZ NPFZH WMJRI AJQ EPDKN JQZM OCZ GVSU YJB
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 2
Each letter is shifted backward by $5$ positions. For example, 'T' becomes 'O', 'H' becomes 'C', 'E' becomes 'Z' (wrapping around from 'A'). Spaces are preserved.

## Sample Input 3
```
ATTACK AT DAWN
0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 3
With a key $K=0$, each letter is shifted by $0$ positions, resulting in no change to the original message.
