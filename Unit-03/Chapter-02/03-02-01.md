# Unit 3 Chapter 2 Question 1 - Receipt

You are required to build a cash register program that takes the input from a scanner of products that have prices attached to them. When an item gets scanned, that basically means the name of the item and the price is inputted by the user. When a zero/blank value is inputted, the scanning will end and the receipt must print out. The receipt must be a receipt.txt file. Consider some fancy string formatting to make a nice receipt. Here's a sample grocery.txt file receipt:

```

For your `with as` statement, use the code below:
```python
import os
receipt = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'receipt.txt')
with open(receipt, 'w') as f:
    f.write("Welcome to Wendy's\n")
```
