# Unit 3 Chapter 1 Question 7 - Prime Checker

Write a program that determines whether a positive integer above 1 (up to 1000000) is a prime number or not.

## Input Specification  
The input consists of a single integer, $P$, where 1 < $P$ < 1000000

## Output Specification  
The output consists of a boolean value, either `True` or `False`

## Sample Input
```
6
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
False
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input
The output is `False` as 6 has 4 factors (1, 2, 3, 6), and so it is not prime.
