# Unit 3 Chapter 1 Question 2 - Faceless Men

Create a program that asks the user what their name is and respond by saying `hello [name]!` then `NEXT!`, looping this scenario over for the next person. If the user responds `A girl has no name`, then the program must respond `*sweats profusely*` without the hello/then print and then it ends.
