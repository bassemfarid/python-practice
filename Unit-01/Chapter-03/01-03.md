# Unit 1 Lesson 3 - Madlibs

You are required to program a MadLibs in python. Create a file called `madlibs.py` in this folder.

Your MadLibs will be a bit more specific than just asking for an adjective/noun to make your story flow better.

## Criteria

Have the following in your program:
- Ask the user the 10 questions. They have to be more specific than just adjective or noun. The questions need to all be asked before the story is presented.
- Store these user inputs into descriptively named variables using the correct programming conventions.
- Make a story using Fstrings (you can use multiple prints) and use all your inputs in the story, referring to them using the variables.
- You are allowed to reuse your variables in your story. This is the essence of data abstraction.
- Remember, if you need to use illegal characters inside a string, they need to be escaped using a backslash.

Submit your madlibs.py file on Brightspace and commit/push it in this practice repository.
