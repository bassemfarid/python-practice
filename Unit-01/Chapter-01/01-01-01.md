# Unit 1 Lesson 1 Question 1

Consider the following code:

```Python
print("I", "like", "chickens")
```

You need to modify the print statement above to print:

```
I$like$chickens
```

- The output must all be on one line
- You must use each word as seperate objects, only use one print statement
- You need to use sep to correctly finish this activity
