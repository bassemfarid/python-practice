# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 9 - The Fractured Cone  

With the twin pillars now revealed, you step forward and find a grand staircase leading to a pedestal at the far end of the chamber. Resting upon it is a fractured cone, seemingly cut through the center. The final riddle appears before you:  

*"To unlock the ultimate treasure, you must understand the volume of the fractured cone. Both its small and large ends hold the key."*  

You notice the cone is a frustum, a truncated cone with two circular ends. To proceed, you must calculate the volume of this frustum given its larger radius, *R₁*, smaller radius, *R₂*, and height, *H*.  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the volume, *V*, of the frustum of a cone using the following formula:
`V = (1/3) * π * H * (R₁² + R₁ * R₂ + R₂²)`

Where:
- *R₁* is the radius of the larger circular end.
- *R₂* is the radius of the smaller circular end.
- *H* is the height of the frustum.
- Use `3.14159` as the value of π.

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, *R₁* (0.1 ≤ R₁ ≤ 1000.0), representing the radius of the larger circular end.  
The second line of input contains a floating-point number, *R₂* (0.1 ≤ R₂ ≤ 1000.0), representing the radius of the smaller circular end.  
The third line of input contains a floating-point number, *H* (0.1 ≤ H ≤ 1000.0), representing the height of the frustum.  

## Output Specification  

Output the volume, *V*, calculated using the given formula. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
6.0
4.0
10.0
```

## Output for Sample Input 

```
795.8694667
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the radii are 6.0 and 4.0, and the height is 10.0, we can calculate the volume as:  

- `V = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 10.0 * (6.0² + 6.0 * 4.0 + 4.0²)`  
- `V = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 10.0 * (36.0 + 24.0 + 16.0)`  
- `V = (1/3) * 3.14159 * 10.0 * 76.0`  
- `V = 795.8694667`  

With this knowledge, the fractured cone begins to glow, and the final treasure is revealed…
