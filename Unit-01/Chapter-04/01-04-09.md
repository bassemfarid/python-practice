# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 9 - The Fractured Cone  

With the twin pillars now revealed, you step forward and find a grand staircase leading to a pedestal at the far end of the chamber. Resting upon it is a fractured cone, seemingly cut through the center. The final riddle appears before you:  

*"To unlock the ultimate treasure, you must understand the volume of the fractured cone. Both its small and large ends hold the key."*  

You notice the cone is a frustum, a truncated cone with two circular ends. To proceed, you must calculate the volume of this frustum given its larger radius, $R_1$, smaller radius, $R_2$, and height, $H$.  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the volume, $V$, of the frustum of a cone using the following formula:
$V = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times H \times \left( R_1^2 + R_1 \times R_2 + R_2^2 \right)$

Where:
- $R_1$ is the radius of the larger circular end.
- $R_2$ is the radius of the smaller circular end.
- $H$ is the height of the frustum.
- Use $3.14159$ as the value of $\pi$.

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, $R_1$, where $0.1 \leq R_1 \leq 1000.0$, representing the radius of the larger circular end.  
The second line of input contains a floating-point number, $R_2$, where $0.1 \leq R_2 \leq 1000.0$, representing the radius of the smaller circular end.  
The third line of input contains a floating-point number, $H$, where $0.1 \leq H \leq 1000.0$, representing the height of the frustum.  

## Output Specification  

Output the volume, $V$, calculated using the given formula. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
6.0
4.0
10.0
```

## Output for Sample Input 

```
795.8694667
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the radii are $6.0$ and $4.0$, and the height is $10.0$, we can calculate the volume as:  

- $V = \frac{1}{3} \times 3.14159 \times 10.0 \times \left( 6.0^2 + 6.0 \times 4.0 + 4.0^2 \right)$
- $V = \frac{1}{3} \times 3.14159 \times 10.0 \times \left( 36.0 + 24.0 + 16.0 \right)$  
- $V = \frac{1}{3} \times 3.14159 \times 10.0 \times 76.0$
- $V = 795.8694667$

With this knowledge, the fractured cone begins to glow, and the final treasure is revealedâ€¦
