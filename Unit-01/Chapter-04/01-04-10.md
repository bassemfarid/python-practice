# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 10 - The End

Once upon a time, in a vibrant and colorful world of code, there lived a little yellow chicken named Pippa. Unlike other chickens who loved to peck at seeds, Pippa was always curious about the world of puzzles. One day, while wandering near a glimmering maze, she found herself face-to-face with a glowing block. On the block was a message: “Solve the puzzle to unlock the next stage!”

Determined, Pippa waddled up to it, adjusting her tiny glasses. The block revealed its first puzzle—a simple coding challenge. It was a maze of logic gates! Pippa thought hard, remembering her lessons in if-statements and loops. With a little peck, she completed the puzzle, and the block vanished, revealing a new one.

As she moved on, the puzzles grew harder. There were equations with hidden variables, pattern recognition tasks, and sequences of code that made her little feathers stand on end. But with each puzzle, Pippa grew more confident. She wasn’t just solving them for the prize. The real treasure was the satisfaction and excitement that bloomed in her chest as each challenge was overcome.

Finally, after solving a particularly tricky problem involving recursion, Pippa reached the last puzzle. It was a giant glowing chest with the message: “Congratulations! You’ve solved all the puzzles!”

But instead of opening the chest to find gold, Pippa realized the true reward was the fun and adventure she’d had along the way. The puzzles had taught her new skills, sparked her creativity, and made her feel proud.

And so, with a happy cluck, Pippa walked away from the chest, knowing that the journey, not the prize, was the real treasure.
