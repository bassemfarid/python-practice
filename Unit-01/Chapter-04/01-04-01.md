# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 1 - The Mysterious Tile

You have discovered a strange, ancient tile in a hidden chamber. The tile is perfectly square, and its side length is marked with a mysterious symbol. To unlock the secrets of the chamber, you must determine the total area of the tile.

Your task is to write a program that calculates the area, $A$ of the tile given its side length, $S$.

## Input Specification

The first line of input contains an integer, $S$, where $1 \leq S \leq 1000$, representing the side length of the square tile.

## Output Specification

Output the area, $A$, calculated as $S \times S$.

## Sample Input

```
5
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
25
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input

Since the side length of the tile is $5$, the area is calculated as $5 \times 5 = 25$.
