# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 7 - The Orb of Power

As the enchanted seal dissolves into light, you step forward into a grand chamber. At its center floats a glowing orb, pulsing with energy. An inscription on the pedestal below reads:  

*"To harness the orb’s power, you must first understand its volume."*  

You realize that the orb is a perfect sphere, and its diameter is inscribed on the pedestal.  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the volume, $V$, of the sphere given its diameter, $D$.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, $D$, where $0.1 \leq D \leq 1000.0$, representing the diameter of the sphere.  

## Output Specification  

Output the volume, $V$, calculated as $\frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times R^3$, where $R$ is the radius $\frac{D}{2}$. Use $3.14159$ as the value of $\pi$. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
6.0
```

## Output for Sample Input  

```
113.09724
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the diameter is 6.0, the radius is calculated as `6.0 / 2 = 3.0`.  
The volume is then calculated as `(4/3) * 3.14159 * 3.0³ = 113.09724`.  
With this knowledge, the Orb of Power begins to glow brighter… something incredible is about to happen.
