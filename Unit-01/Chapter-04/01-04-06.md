# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 6 - The Enchanted Seal  

As you unlock the ancient vault, you find a large circular seal on the floor, covered in glowing symbols. A riddle inscribed on the seal reads:  

*"The key to opening this door lies in understanding the space within my boundary."*  

You realize that to proceed, you must calculate the area of the circular seal.  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the area, *A*, of the circle given its radius, *R*.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, *R* (0.1 ≤ R ≤ 1000.0), representing the radius of the circle.  

## Output Specification  

Output the area, *A*, calculated as `π * R * R`. Use `3.14159` as the value of π. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
2.5
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
19.6349375
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the radius is 2.5, the area is calculated as `3.14159 * 2.5 * 2.5 = 19.6349375`.  
With this knowledge, the enchanted seal may reveal what lies beyond.
