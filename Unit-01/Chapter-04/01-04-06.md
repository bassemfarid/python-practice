# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 6 - The Enchanted Seal  

As you unlock the ancient vault, you find a large circular seal on the floor, covered in glowing symbols. A riddle inscribed on the seal reads:  

*"The key to opening this door lies in understanding the space within my boundary."*  

You realize that to proceed, you must calculate the area of the circular seal.  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the area, $A$, of the circle given its radius, $R$.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, $R$, where $0.1 \leq R \leq 1000.0$, representing the radius of the circle.  

## Output Specification  

Output the area, *A*, calculated as $\pi \times R^2$. Use $3.14159$ as the value of $\pi$. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
2.5
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
19.6349375
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the radius is $2.5$, the area is calculated as $3.14159 \times 2.5^2 = 19.6349375$.  
With this knowledge, the enchanted seal may reveal what lies beyond.
