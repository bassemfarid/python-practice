# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 4 - The Mystic Cube

As you decipher the triangular inscription, the chamber rumbles, and a stone pedestal rises from the ground. Resting on it is a perfectly shaped cube, glowing faintly with an unknown energy. An inscription on the pedestal states:  

*"Only those who understand the cube’s true volume may proceed."*  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the volume, $V$, of the cube given its side length, $S$.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, $S$, where $0.1 \leq S \leq 1000.0$, representing the side length of the cube.  

## Output Specification  

Output the volume, $V$, calculated as cubing the value $S$. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
3.0
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
27.0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the side length of the cube is $3.0$, the volume is calculated as $3.0^3 = 27.0$.
This value might be the key to unlocking the next part of your journey.
