# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 4 - The Mystic Cube

As you decipher the triangular inscription, the chamber rumbles, and a stone pedestal rises from the ground. Resting on it is a perfectly shaped cube, glowing faintly with an unknown energy. An inscription on the pedestal states:  

*"Only those who understand the cube’s true volume may proceed."*  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the volume, *V*, of the cube given its side length, *S*.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, *S* (0.1 ≤ S ≤ 1000.0), representing the side length of the cube.  

## Output Specification  

Output the volume, *V*, calculated as cubing the value s. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
3.0
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
27.0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the side length of the cube is 3.0, the volume is calculated as `3.0 * 3.0 * 3.0 = 27.0`.  
This value might be the key to unlocking the next part of your journey.
