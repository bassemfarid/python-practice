# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 8 - The Twin Pillars  

As the Orb of Power glows brightly, the chamber trembles, and two towering pillars rise from the ground. A carved message between them reads:  

*"Only those who understand the total surface of the twin pillars shall pass."*  

You realize that each pillar is shaped like a perfect cylinder, and to proceed, you must calculate its total surface area, including both the curved side and the two circular ends.  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the surface area, $A$, of a single pillar given its height, $H$, and radius, $R$.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, $H$, where $0.1 \leq H \leq 1000.0$, representing the height of the cylinder.  
The second line of input contains a floating-point number, $R$, where $0.1 \leq R \leq 1000.0$, representing the radius of the cylinder.  

## Output Specification  

Output the surface area, *A*, of the cylinder using the formula: $A = 2 \times \pi \times R \times H + 2 \times \pi \times R^2$

Use $3.14159$ as the value of $\pi$. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
5.0
2.0
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
87.96452
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the height is $5.0$ and the radius is $2.0$:  

- The lateral surface area (curved side) is $2 \times 3.14159 \times 2.0 \times 5.0 = 62.8318$  
- The area of both circular ends is $2 \times 3.14159 \times 2^2 = 25.13272$ 
- The total surface area is $62.8318 + 25.13272 = 87.96452$

With this knowledge, the twin pillars begin to shift, revealing the final challenge ahead...
