# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 3 - The Inscription  

As the hidden door opens, you step into a dimly lit chamber. At the center of the room lies an ancient pedestal with a triangular inscription. A cryptic message on the wall suggests that the area of this triangle holds the key to the next puzzle.  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the area, $A$, of the triangle given its base, $B$, and height, $H$.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, $B$, where $0.1 \leq B \leq 1000.0$, representing the base of the triangle.
The second line of input contains a floating-point number, $H$, where $0.1 \leq H \leq 1000.0$, representing the height of the triangle.  

## Output Specification  

Output the area, $A$, calculated as the half of the base multiplied by the height. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.

## Sample Input

```
8.0
5.0
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
20.0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the base of the triangle is $8.0$ and the height is $5.0$, the area is calculated as $\frac{8.0 \times 5.0}{2} = 20.0$.  
This value may reveal the secrets hidden within the chamber.
