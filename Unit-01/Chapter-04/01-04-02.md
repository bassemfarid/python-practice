# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 2 - The Hidden Door

After unlocking the secrets of the ancient tile, you notice a faint outline on the chamber wall—it’s a hidden door! However, to open it, you must calculate the area of a special engraved rectangle on its surface. The door’s mechanism requires an exact measurement based on its height and width.

Your task is to write a program that calculates the area, $A$, of the rectangle given its height, $H$, and width, $W$.

## Input Specification

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, $H$, where $0.1 \leq H \leq 1000.0$, representing the height of the rectangle.  
The second line of input contains a floating-point number, $W$, where $0.1 \leq W \leq 1000.0$, representing the width of the rectangle.

## Output Specification

Output the area, $A$, calculated as the height multiplied by the width. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.

## Sample Input

```
4.5
2.0
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
9.0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input

Since the height of the rectangle is $4.5$ and the width is $2.0$, the area is calculated as $4.5 \times 2.0 = 9.0$.  
This value is required to unlock the hidden door.
