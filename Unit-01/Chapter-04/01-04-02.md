# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 2 - The Hidden Door

After unlocking the secrets of the ancient tile, you notice a faint outline on the chamber wall—it’s a hidden door! However, to open it, you must calculate the area of a special engraved rectangle on its surface. The door’s mechanism requires an exact measurement based on its height and width.

Your task is to write a program that calculates the area, _A_, of the rectangle given its height, _H_, and width, _W_.

## Input Specification

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, _H_ (0.1 ≤ H ≤ 1000.0), representing the height of the rectangle.  
The second line of input contains a floating-point number, _W_ (0.1 ≤ W ≤ 1000.0), representing the width of the rectangle.

## Output Specification

Output the area, _A_, calculated as the height multiplied by the width. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.

## Sample Input

```
4.5
2.0
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
9.0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input

Since the height of the rectangle is 4.5 and the width is 2.0, the area is calculated as `4.5 * 2.0 = 9.0`.  
This value is required to unlock the hidden door.
