# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 6 - The Ancient Vault  

As you solve the mystery of the cube, the pedestal slowly lowers into the ground, revealing a passageway leading to an ancient vault. Inside, you find a massive stone container shaped like a rectangular prism. An inscription on the container reads:  

*"Only those who can measure my true volume may uncover the treasure within."*  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the volume, $V$, of the rectangular prism given its height, $H$, length, $L$, and width, $W$.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, $H$, where $0.1 \leq H \leq 1000.0$, representing the height of the rectangular prism.  
The second line of input contains a floating-point number, $L$, where $0.1 \leq L \leq 1000.0$, representing the length of the rectangular prism.  
The third line of input contains a floating-point number, $W$, where $0.1 \leq W \leq 1000.0$, representing the width of the rectangular prism.  

## Output Specification

Output the volume, $V$, calculated as multiplying all the values together. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.

## Sample Input

```
4.0
3.0
2.5
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
30.0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the height is $4.0$, the length is $3.0$, and the width is $2.5$, the volume is calculated as $4.0 \times 3.0 \times 2.5 = 30.0$.  
With this knowledge, you may now attempt to open the ancient vault.
