# Unit 1 Lesson 4 Question 6 - The Ancient Vault  

As you solve the mystery of the cube, the pedestal slowly lowers into the ground, revealing a passageway leading to an ancient vault. Inside, you find a massive stone container shaped like a rectangular prism. An inscription on the container reads:  

*"Only those who can measure my true volume may uncover the treasure within."*  

Your task is to write a program that calculates the volume, *V*, of the rectangular prism given its height, *H*, length, *L*, and width, *W*.  

## Input Specification  

The first line of input contains a floating-point number, *H* (0.1 ≤ H ≤ 1000.0), representing the height of the rectangular prism.  
The second line of input contains a floating-point number, *L* (0.1 ≤ L ≤ 1000.0), representing the length of the rectangular prism.  
The third line of input contains a floating-point number, *W* (0.1 ≤ W ≤ 1000.0), representing the width of the rectangular prism.  

## Output Specification

Output the volume, *V*, calculated as multiplying all the values together. The output must be displayed as a floating-point number.  

## Sample Input

```
4.0
3.0
2.5
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
30.0
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  

Since the height is 4.0, the length is 3.0, and the width is 2.5, the volume is calculated as `4.0 * 3.0 * 2.5 = 30.0`.  
With this knowledge, you may now attempt to open the ancient vault.
