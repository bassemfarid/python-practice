# Unit 2 Chapter 3 Question 1 - Equality Check  
Create a program that takes in an integer and determines if it is **equal to 5 or not**. The program should print `equal` if the number is $5$ and `not equal` otherwise.  

## Input Specification  
The line of input contains an integer, $N$, where $-1000000 \leq N \leq 1000000$.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a string, either `equal` or `not equal`.  

## Sample Input
```
5
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
Equal
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
Since $N = 5$, it matches the required value, so the output is `equal`.
