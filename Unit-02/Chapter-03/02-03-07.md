# Unit 2 Chapter 3 Question 7 - Triangle Angle Validity Check  
Create a program that takes in **three angles** and determines whether they can form a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of its three angles is exactly $180 \degree$.  

## Input Specification  
The input consists of three integers, each provided on a separate line:  
- The first line contains $A$ (the first angle).  
- The second line contains $B$ (the second angle).  
- The third line contains $C$ (the third angle).  
All values satisfy $0  \le A, B, C \leq 180$.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a string, either `valid triangle` or `not a valid triangle`.  

## Sample Input
```
60
60
60
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
valid triangle
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
Since $A = 60$, $B = 60$, and $C = 60$, the sum is:  
$ 60 + 60 + 60 = 180 $  
Since the total is exactly $180 \degree$, the output is `valid triangle`.
