# Unit 2 Chapter 3 Question 6 - Range Inclusion Check  
Create a program that takes in **two numbers** and a **third number** and determines whether the third number falls **between the first two numbers, inclusive**. The program should print `between` if it is inside the range (including the boundaries) and `not between` otherwise.  

## Input Specification  
The input consists of three numbers, each provided on a separate line:  
- The first line contains $A$.  
- The second line contains $B$.  
- The third line contains $X$ (the number to check).  
All values satisfy $-1000000 \leq A, B, X \leq 1000000$.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a string, either `between` or `not between`.  

## Sample Input
```
10
20
15
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
between
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
The given numbers $A = 10$ and $B = 20$ define a range that includes all numbers from **10 to 20, inclusive**.  
Since $X = 15$ falls within this range, the output is `between`.
