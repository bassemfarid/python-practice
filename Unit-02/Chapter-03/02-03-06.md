# Unit 2 Chapter 3 Question 6 - Range Inclusion Check  
Create a program that takes in **two numbers** and a **third number** and determines whether the third number falls **between the first two numbers, inclusive**. The program should print `"between"` if it is inside the range (including the boundaries) and `"not between"` otherwise.  

## Input Specification  
The input consists of three numbers, each provided on a separate line:  
- The first line contains *A*.  
- The second line contains *B*.  
- The third line contains *X* (the number to check).  
All values satisfy `-1000000 ≤ A, B, X ≤ 1000000`.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a string, either `"between"` or `"not between"`.  

## Sample Input
```
20
10
15
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
between
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
The given numbers *A = 20* and *B = 10* define a range that includes all numbers from **10 to 20, inclusive**.  
Since *X = 15* falls within this range, the output is `"between"`.
