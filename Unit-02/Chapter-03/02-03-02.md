# Unit 2 Chapter 3 Question 2 - Odd or Even  
Create a program that takes in an integer and determines whether it is **odd or even**. The program should print `even` if the number is even and `odd` if the number is odd.  

## Input Specification  
The line of input contains an integer, $N$, where $-1000000 \leq N \leq 1000000$.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a string, either `even` or `odd`.  

## Sample Input
```
7
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
odd
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
Since $N = 7$ is not divisible by 2, it is **odd**, so the output is `odd`.
