# Unit 2 Chapter 3 Question 8 - Triangle Side Validity Check  
Create a program that takes in **three sides** and determines whether they can form a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side.  

## Input Specification  
The input consists of three integers, each provided on a separate line:  
- The first line contains $A$ (the length of the first side).  
- The second line contains $B$ (the length of the second side).  
- The third line contains $C$ (the length of the third side).  
All values satisfy $0 \leq A, B, C \leq 1000$.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a string, either `valid triangle` or `not a valid triangle`.  

## Sample Input
```
3
4
5
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
valid triangle
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
For the sides $A = 3$, $B = 4$, and $C = 5$, we check the following conditions:  
- $ 3 + 4 > 5 $ *True*
- $ 3 + 5 > 4 $ *True*  
- $ 4 + 5 > 3 $ *True* 
Since all three conditions are met, the output is `valid triangle`.
