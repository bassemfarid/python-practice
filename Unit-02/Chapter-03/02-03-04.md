# Unit 2 Chapter 3 Question 4 - Number Comparison  
Create a program that takes in two numerical inputs and determines whether the first number is **bigger than the second number**. The program should print `bigger` if the first number is greater and `not bigger` otherwise.  

## Input Specification  
The input consists of two numbers, $A$ and $B$, where $-1000000 \leq A, B \leq 1000000$. $A$ and $B$ may be integers or floating-point numbers.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a string, either `bigger` or `not bigger`.  

## Sample Input
```
10
5
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
bigger
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
Since $A = 10$ is **greater than** $B = 5$, the output is `bigger`.
