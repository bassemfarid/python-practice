# Unit 2 Chapter 3 Question 5 - Profit Calculation  
Create a program that takes in **product revenue** and **product costs** (as separate inputs) and determines the profit. If the profit is **greater than 0**, print the profit amount. Otherwise, print `not profitable`.  

## Input Specification  
The input consists of two integers provided on separate lines:  
- The first line contains $R$ (product revenue).  
- The second line contains $C$ (product costs).  
Both values satisfy $-1000000 \leq R, C \leq 1000000$.  

## Output Specification  
If the profit $R - C$ is greater than $0$, output the profit amount as an integer. Otherwise, output `not profitable`.  

## Sample Input
```
200
150
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
50
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
Since $R = 200$ and $C = 150$, the profit is:  
$ 200 - 150 = 50 $  
Since the profit is **greater than 0**, the program outputs `50`.
