# Unit 2 Chapter 1 Question 5 - Grade Average Check  
Create a program that takes in three student grades and determines whether their average is **80 or above**.  

## Input Specification  
The input consists of three numbers, $G_1$, $G_2$, and $G_3$, where each grade satisfies $0 \leq G \leq 100$.

## Output Specification  
The output will be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.  

## Sample Input

```
75
85
80
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
True
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input

1. Compute the average:  
   $ \frac{75 + 85 + 80}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 $  
2. Since $80$ is **equal to** 80, the output is `True`.
