# Unit 2 Chapter 1 Question 3 - Absolute Value Check  
Create a program that takes in a number, $N$, and outputs whether its absolute value is less than or equal to $5$.

## Input Specification  
The line of input contains a number, $N$, where $-1000000 \leq N \leq 1000000$.

## Output Specification  
The output will be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.

## Sample Input

```
-3.5
```

## Output for Sample Input
