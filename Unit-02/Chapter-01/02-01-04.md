# Unit 2 Chapter 1 Question 4 - Transformation Comparison
Create a program that takes in a number, $N$, performs a transformation, and determines whether the result is greater than the original number.  

The transformation is as follows:
1. Multiply $N$ by $3$.
2. Subtract $20$.
3. Divide the result by $2$.

The program should then output whether the transformed number is greater than $N$.

## Input Specification

The line of input contains a number, $N$, where $-1000000 \leq N \leq 1000000$.

## Output Specification

The output will be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.

## Sample Input

```
10
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
False
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
1. $ \left( 10 \times 3 \right) - 20 = 30 - 20 = 10 $  
2. $ 10 \div 2 = 5 $  
3. Since $5$ is **not** greater than $10$, the output is `False`.
