# Unit 2 Chapter 2 Question 5 - Divisibility Check  
Create a program that takes in an integer, $N$, and outputs whether it is **divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3**.  

## Input Specification  
The line of input contains an integer, $N$, where $-1000000 \leq N \leq 1000000$.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.  

## Sample Input 
```
8
```

## Output for Sample Input  
```
True
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
- $N = 8$ is **divisible by 2** ($8 ÷ 2 = 4$), remainder $0$.  
- $N = 8$ is **not divisible by 3** ($8 ÷ 3 ≈ 2.67$), remainder $2$.  
- Since both conditions are met, the output is `True`.
