# Unit 2 Chapter 2 Question 4 - Complex Range Check  
Create a program that takes in a number, *N*, and outputs whether it is **between 25 and 30 (exclusive) or between 50 and 55 (inclusive)**.  

## Input Specification  
The line of input contains a number, *N*, where `-1000000 ≤ N ≤ 1000000`. *N* may be an integer or a floating-point number.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.  

## Sample Input
```
27
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
True
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
Since *N = 27*, and it falls **between 25 and 30 (exclusive)**, the output is `True`.
