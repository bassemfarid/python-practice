# Unit 2 Chapter 2 Question 4 - Complex Range Check  
Create a program that takes in a number, $N$, and outputs whether it is **between 25 and 30 (exclusive) or between 50 and 55 (inclusive)**.  

## Input Specification  
The line of input contains a number, *N*, where $-1000000 \leq N \leq 1000000$.

## Output Specification  
The output will be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.  

## Sample Input
```
27
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
True
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
Since $N = 27$, and it falls **between 25 and 30 (exclusive)**, the output is `True`.
