# Unit 2 Chapter 2 Question 2 - Not Equal to 8 or 10  
Create a program that takes in a number, $N$, and outputs whether it is **not equal to 8 or not equal to 10**.  

## Input Specification  
The line of input contains a number, *N*, where $-1000000 \leq N \leq 1000000$. $N$ may be an integer or a floating-point number.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.  

## Sample Input

```
8
```

## Output for Sample Input

```
True
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input  
Since $N = 8$, it is **not equal to 10**, which satisfies the condition, so the output is `True`.
