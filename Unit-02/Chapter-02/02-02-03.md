Create a program that takes in a number, *N*, and outputs whether it is **between 1 and 10, inclusive**.  

## Input Specification  
The line of input contains a number, *N*, where `-1000000 ≤ N ≤ 1000000`. *N* may be an integer or a floating-point number.  

## Output Specification  
The output will be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.  

## Sample Input

```
5
```
