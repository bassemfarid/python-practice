# Unit 2 Chapter 4 Question 4 - Fizz Buzz Single Number
In the classic game "Fizz Buzz", children sit in a circle and count up from one. However, there's a twist: if a number is divisible by 3, they say "Fizz" instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, they say "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, they say "Fizz Buzz". Otherwise, they just say the number.

Instead of playing the full game, your task is to determine what should be said for a single given number, $N$.

## Input Specification
The input consists of a single line containing a positive integer, $N$. It is guaranteed that $1 \le N \le 1000$.

## Output Specification
Output the correct response based on the Fizz Buzz rules for the input number $N$.
- If $N$ is divisible by both 3 and 5, output `Fizz Buzz`.
- If $N$ is divisible by 3 but not 5, output `Fizz`.
- If $N$ is divisible by 5 but not 3, output `Buzz`.
- If $N$ is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5, output the number $N$ itself.

## Sample Input 1
```
9
```

## Output for Sample Input 1
```
Fizz
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 1
$9$ is divisible by 3 but not by $5$, so the output is `Fizz`.

## Sample Input 2
```
20
```

## Output for Sample Input 2
```
Buzz
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 2
$20$ is divisible by 5 but not by $3$, so the output is `Buzz`.

## Sample Input 3
```
30
```

## Output for Sample Input 3
```
Fizz Buzz
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 3
$30$ is divisible by both $3$ and $5$, so the output is `Fizz Buzz`.

## Sample Input 4
```
11
```

## Output for Sample Input 4
```
11
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 4
$11$ is not divisible by $3$ or $5$, so the output is the number itself.
