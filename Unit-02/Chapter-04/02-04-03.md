# Unit 2 Chapter 4 Question 3 - The Tallest Sibling
Three siblings, Alex, Ben, and Chloe, are arguing about who is the tallest. They measure their heights but need your help to determine which measurement represents the tallest sibling. You are given their heights as three separate numbers.

Let the heights be represented by $A$, $B$, and $C$.

## Input Specification
There are three lines of input. Each line contains a non-negative integer representing the height of a sibling.
The first line contains $A$.
The second line contains $B$.
The third line contains $C$.

## Output Specification
Output a single integer which is the largest of the three input heights, $A$, $B$, and $C$. You are not allowed to use the built-in `max` function or equivalent for this task.

## Sample Input 1
```
150
165
158
```

## Output for Sample Input 1
```
165
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 1
comparing the three heights, $165$ is greater than both $150$ and $158$. Therefore, the output is `165`.

## Sample Input 2
```
172
160
172
```

## Output for Sample Input 2
```
172
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 2
comparing the three heights, $172$ is greater than $160$ and equal to the other $172$. Therefore, the output is `172`.
