# Unit 2 Chapter 4 Question 5 - Federal Tax Bracket Finder
Navigating the Canadian tax system can be complex! One of the first steps is understanding which federal tax bracket your annual income falls into. This helps determine the rate at which your income is taxed at the federal level.

You are given a yearly salary and need to determine which of the five federal tax brackets it belongs to based on the 2024 tax year ranges.

Here are the 2024 Canadian Federal Tax Brackets:

| Bracket Number | Taxable Income Range                     |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| 1              | up to $55,867                            |
| 2              | over $55,867 up to $111,733              |
| 3              | over $111,733 up to $173,205             |
| 4              | over $173,205 up to $246,752             |
| 5              | over $246,752                           |

Your task is to take a given salary and identify the corresponding bracket number (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
