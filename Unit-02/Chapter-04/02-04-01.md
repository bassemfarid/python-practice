# Unit 2 Chapter 4 Question 1 - Day of the Week

Imagine you are programming a calendar application. Users often input dates numerically, but you want to display the actual name of the day for better readability. Your task is to convert a number representing the day of the week into its corresponding name.

Let $D$ be the number representing the day of the week.

## Input Specification
The input consists of a single line containing an integer, $D$. The problem assumes that $1$ represents Sunday, $2$ represents Monday, and so on, up to $7$ representing Saturday.

## Output Specification
If the input number $D$ is between 1 and 7 (inclusive), print the corresponding day of the week (e.g., `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`). If the input number $D$ is outside this range, print `invalid argument`.

## Sample Input 1
```
3
```

## Output for Sample Input 1
```
Tuesday

```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 1
The input is `3`. Since $1$ is Sunday and $2$ is Monday, $3$ corresponds to Tuesday.

## Sample Input 2
```
9
```

## Output for Sample Input 2
```
invalid argument
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 2
The input is `9`. Since this value is outside the valid range of $1$ to $7$, the output is `invalid argument`.
