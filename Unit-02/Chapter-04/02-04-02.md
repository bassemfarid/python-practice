# Unit 2 Chapter 4 Question 2 - Number Sign Check

In many mathematical and programming tasks, you need to understand the sign of a number. For instance, when analyzing financial data, you might need to quickly categorize values as gains (positive), losses (negative), or no change (zero). This exercise helps practice this basic classification.

Let $N$ be the number provided.

## Input Specification
The input consists of a single line containing an integer, $N$.

## Output Specification
Output a single word indicating the sign of the number $N$.
- If $N > 0$, output `positive`.
- If $N < 0$, output `negative`.
- If $N = 0$, output `zero`.

## Sample Input 1
```
5
```

## Output for Sample Input 1
```
positive
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 1
The input number $N$ is `5`. Since $5 > 0$, the output is `positive`.

## Sample Input 2
```
-10
```

## Output for Sample Input 2
```
negative
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 2
The input number $N$ is `-10`. Since $-10 < 0$, the output is `negative`.

## Sample Input 3
```
0
```

## Output for Sample Input 3
```
zero
```

## Explanation of Output for Sample Input 3
The input number $N$ is `0`. Since $N = 0$, the output is `zero`.
